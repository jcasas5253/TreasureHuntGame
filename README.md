Connections to the larger field of computer science:

Software programs are designed and developed by computer scientists. This covers everything, from operating systems to video games to websites and mobile apps.
Algorithms are collections of instructions that computer scientists create in order to solve issues. Everything from financial trading platforms to search engines uses algorithms.
New technologies are researched and developed by computer scientists as well. This covers fields including natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Nowadays, computer scientists are essential to society. They are in charge of creating the technology and software that we use on a daily basis. We wouldn't have cellphones, the internet, or any other digital technology that we take for granted without computer scientists.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When solving an issue, computer scientists divide it up into smaller, easier-to-manage components. After that, they create algorithms to solve each of these component pieces. The algorithms may be put into code after they are developed.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Preserving the players' privacy.
Refraining from using derogatory or discriminating words.
